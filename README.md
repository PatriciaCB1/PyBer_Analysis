# PyBer_Analysis

  ## Resources
  - Data Sources:  city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
  - Software:  Anaconda 4.9.2, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3 , Python 3.7.6 
  - Using:  Pandas, NumPy
  
## Overview of the analysis:

A rideshare company, PyBer, was interested in conducting analysis on city and ride data held by the business to better understand ride-sharing by city type.  Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.  Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  This data visualization of the results helped the CEO of PyBer to understand week-to-week trends for fares by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural), specifically for rides occuring during the range of weeks from January 1st, 2019 to April 29th, 2029.

This summary report will summarize how the data differed by city type and how those differences can be used by the decision-makers at PyBer.


## Purpose of the analysis

The main purpose of this further analysis is to visualize weekly trends for fare data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) across a set time period, January 1st 2019 to April 29th, 2029.  The visualization of the data will help make the findings more digestable for stakeholders.  We will also advise on how the differences in data can be used by decision-makers at PyBer to maximize business performance.

## Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
